# 2024 KenPom Exploration
 Python Sport Analytics Final Project
 Interactive Jupyter Notebook that explores Adjusted Efficiency Margin, Adjusted Offensive Efficiency, Adjusted Defensive Efficiency, and Adjusted Tempo from KenPom.com. Scatterplots utilize NCAA team logos courtesy of sportslogos.net to show teams strengths and weaknesses, as well as helping users characterize team play styles ahead of conference tournaments and the Big Dance. Interactive scatterplots allow users to visualize distribution of teams measures by conference and efficiency and tempo. The project can be used as a tool to provoke thought as to how teams with contrasting play styles will match up. Does a fast or slow tempo/pace of play dictate the overall tempo of the game? Is high-powered offense more valuable than a stalwart defensive when teams face each other on a neutral court? Is it better to be elite on one side of the ball or are more well-rounded and balanced teams suited for success in big games? These are some intriguing questions that I attempt to answer as I offer this notebook as a resource to refer back to and think critically about how college basketball matchups unfold in March.
